b)	The second message asks how many units of the product they would like to buy.
3.	Once the customer has placed the order, the application checks if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request. If not, the app logs the phrase Insufficient quantity!!! Cannot buy all these items, it prevents the order from going through and ask the user If the store does have enough of the product, it fulfills the customer's order. This is; 
a) updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity. and 
b) Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.
